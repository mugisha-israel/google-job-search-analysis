Digital may include endemic and non-endemic 3rd party platforms, Emails, EHRs, or Banners. Personal promotion may include Representative calls, speaker events, and lunch and learn. Enterprise Analytics will be critical to the success of our efforts, and focus areas will include how we measure, track, monitor, draw insights from, and integrate tactics and campaigns across these channels to maximize return on investment and impact.

The Director, Enterprise Analytics and Data Science contributes to defining the resource allocation and optimization... strategy for various Oncology Brands. This individual will provide analytical support through data science in the campaign measurement, experimental design, data mining, and response modeling using large internal and external physician-level datasets.

The Director will work closely with the Digital team and Brand teams within Novartis Oncology Business units such as Solid Tumors and Hematology to develop new techniques and standardization across the analytics organization. In addition to conducting data science and enterprise analytics, the individual in this role will collaborate closely with global data science teams to conduct modeling and piloting for various brands.

Support Enterprise Analytics & Data Science in the development, implementation, and communication of marketing response models measuring effectiveness of marketing channels, campaigns, and messages. Support development and enhancements of marketing mix optimizers for future marketing spend mix recommendations and alignment with brand sales forecasts.

Lead development, implementation, coordination, and communication of decision engine models for recommending optimal channel engagements for HCPs. Work closely with Brand and NPP teams to coordinate rules requirements that are layered on top of the recommendations from the models.

Assist in the creation of Non-personal promotion (NPP) campaigns: Work with NPP team, Brand Analysts, and external vendors in setting up specific campaigns (for HCPs), including List creation, Test Control design set up, KPI metrics and Dashboards.

Lead the problem solving on Metrics and KPIs, especially as these relate to new channels/tactics, leading the problem solving with vendors and internal partners on identifying the right set of KPIs, Metrics to track for new tactics. Develop appropriate communications (e.g., presentation documents) to share with broader organization.

Understand various promotional channels including functional understanding of emerging channels such as Digital, Point of care, EHR from measurement perspective.

Solve NPP analytics related questions and seek to develop a Novartis perspective. Sample questions include: Does sequencing of channels matter, and how (e.g., Direct mail followed by a Rep detail)? What strategies yield the best result for different channels/tactics (e.g., how many Direct mail touches are optimal or who to target for EHR campaign)? Measure the effectiveness of various NPP initiatives from the incremental Rx lift and ROI perspective.

Collaborate with brand analysts on creation of target Lists, segmentation, and response models: Regularly work with prescriber level Rx data to ensure marketing effectiveness and answer critical business questions through sophisticated statistical techniques. Perform design of experiments and advanced statistical analyses to learn the success of marketing efforts.

Identify areas for the application of big data predictive analytics applications in NPP efforts. Be externally focused in leveraging ideas from other industries or pharma companies. Support Agile Marketing requiring fast turnaround on analytic measurements.

Challenge the status quo, and bring outside pharma insights: Challenge external vendors and internal Novartis teams to think differently, and leap frog others in the pharma industry – e.g., around when and how to use different channels, how to measure success, how to make trade off decisions. Constant learning of new marketing techniques and knowledge of 3rd party providers to inform discussions with brand marketers and channel partners is important.

Train and mentor teams on data science: Provide hands on advisement to fellow analysts on how to measure, what good looks like, what not to measure, how to set up experiments etc. Create standardized processes, templates etc. for further rollout to the organization.
